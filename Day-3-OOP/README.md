## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are templates or blueprints for creating objects with specific properties and methods.</p>
<p>OOP is a way of organizing and structuring code by modeling real-world entities or concepts as objects, and then using those objects to build complex software systems. It provides a way to write modular and reusable code, making it easier to maintain and extend software over time.</p>

#### Some key concepts of OOP include:

<li>
<ol><b>Encapsulation: <b>The idea of bundling data and methods that operate onthat data within one unit, preventing access from outside that unit.</ol>
<ol><b>Inheritance: <b>Objects can inherit properties and methods from otherobjects. In OOP, inheritance allows developers to create new classes based onexisting ones, reducing the amount of redundant code.</ol>
<ol><b>Polymorphism: <b>The ability to use objects of different types in thesame way, providing a more flexible and modular approach to programming.</ol>
<ol><b>Abstraction: <b>The idea of reducing complexity by hiding unnecessarydetails from the user.</ol>
</li>
<p>Overall, OOP provides a powerful way of modeling complex systems, allowing developers to write more modular and reusable code, and making it easier to maintain and extend software over time. </p>
